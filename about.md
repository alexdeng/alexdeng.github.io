I'm a data and applied scientist on the [Microsoft Analysis and Experimentation Team](http://www.exp-platform.com). The Analysis and Experimentation team is responsible for one of the largest and best cutting-edge online experimentation system in the industry. I'm currently leading a team focusing on methodological improvements of the experimentation platform and tackling the related engineering challenges.

I finished my Ph.D. study in statistics at Stanford in 2010 focusing on sequential Monte Carlo with [Prof. Tze Lai](https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/tze-leung-lai). I have broad interests in all kinds of statistical methods, web programing, data visualization and physics.
